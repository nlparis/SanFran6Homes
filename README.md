# SanFran6Homes
There are at least 6 homes you may stay in in San Francisco (for a few nights, probably.) This web app will help you find one (probably.)

This site contains 3 interesting metric I found, metric1: Price per person mapped, metric2: Yearly Earnings for one particular location, metric3: Occupancy Rate.

I also have a price estimation feature where a user may enter a geo-location within San Francisco and get an estimate of how much one would make in a week with an Airbnb property there.

Lastly I have a bookings optimization feature that calculates the best price per night for an Airbnb given a geo-location.

Sources:
plot.ly - for metric 1
http://www.chartjs.org and their javascript files for metrics 2 and 3
https://www.latlong.net/place/san-francisco-ca-usa-594.html for San Francisco's geo-location (latitude/longitude)
https://jekyllrb.com to run my site locally and for an attempted use of their code structure. (Upon putting my code on github Jekyll did not sync with my html the same way as it did locally.)
